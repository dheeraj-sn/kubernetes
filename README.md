# Kubernetes Basics for Backend Engineers - Practical Learning Guide

## Overview
This guide will teach you the essential Kubernetes concepts that every backend engineer must know through hands-on practice. We'll start from the basics and gradually build up to more complex scenarios.

## Prerequisites
- Docker Desktop installed and running
- kubectl CLI tool installed
- A basic understanding of containers and Docker

## Learning Path

### Phase 1: Foundation (Day 1-2)
1. **Setup Local Kubernetes Environment**
   - Install and configure Minikube or Docker Desktop Kubernetes
   - Verify cluster is running
   - Basic kubectl commands

2. **Core Concepts - Pods**
   - Create your first pod
   - Understand pod lifecycle
   - Pod configuration and YAML structure
   - Pod networking basics

3. **Core Concepts - Services**
   - Create ClusterIP, NodePort, and LoadBalancer services
   - Understand service discovery
   - Service networking and endpoints

### Phase 2: Application Deployment (Day 3-4)
4. **Deployments**
   - Create and manage deployments
   - Rolling updates and rollbacks
   - Scaling applications
   - Deployment strategies

5. **ConfigMaps and Secrets**
   - Manage application configuration
   - Handle sensitive data
   - Environment-specific configs

6. **Health Checks**
   - Liveness and readiness probes
   - Application health monitoring
   - Graceful shutdowns

### Phase 3: Advanced Concepts (Day 5-6)
7. **Namespaces and Resource Management**
   - Organize resources with namespaces
   - Resource quotas and limits
   - RBAC basics

8. **Storage**
   - Persistent Volumes (PV) and Persistent Volume Claims (PVC)
   - Configuring storage for applications
   - Stateful applications

9. **Networking Deep Dive**
   - Ingress controllers
   - Network policies
   - Service mesh concepts (Istio basics)

### Phase 4: Real-World Scenarios (Day 7)
10. **Complete Application Deployment**
    - Deploy a multi-tier application
    - Database with persistent storage
    - API service with load balancing
    - Frontend application

11. **Monitoring and Debugging**
    - kubectl debugging techniques
    - Logs and troubleshooting
    - Basic monitoring setup

12. **CI/CD Integration**
    - Deploy from Git repository
    - Automated deployments
    - Blue-green deployments

## What You'll Build
Throughout this journey, you'll create:
- A simple web application
- A REST API service
- A database with persistent storage
- A complete microservices architecture
- Monitoring and logging setup

## Expected Outcomes
By the end of this guide, you'll be able to:
- Deploy applications to Kubernetes clusters
- Manage application lifecycle and scaling
- Handle configuration and secrets
- Troubleshoot common issues
- Understand Kubernetes architecture
- Integrate with CI/CD pipelines
